## AIRPORT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DATABASE



### PROJECT OVERVIEW

Airport facilities rely on a number of systems in order to perform some airport and airline processes and I am creating a 
database as a combination of airlines and airport in which, not only our focus will be on the airline system but primarily 
my focus will be to create a database for the airport system as well. As Airport system is a database project that primarily 
deals with the management of the airport, airlines, passengers and employees working for an airport.
